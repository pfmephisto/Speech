# Speech
A plugin for Rhino Grasshopper to process speech  

This plugin is a study on how speech to text translation can be brought into a Grasshopper.

The project is in its infancy with a somewhat working implementation using the .Net framework and a first attempt at using the Mozilla DeepSpeech project, the intention being to switching to a opensource model that would be more platform independent.
